# Project Setup & Usage Guide

This document outlines the steps needed to **install** dependencies, **initialize the database**, and **run** the Python application.

---

## 1. Installation

Before running the app, ensure you have a compatible version of Python (e.g., 3.8 or higher). Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Tip**: For a clean environment, consider creating and activating a virtual environment:
> ```bash
> python -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/Mac)
> venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
> ```

---

## 2. Database Initialization

Initialize the database schema with a single command:

```bash
invoke init-db
```

- **Script Location**: This command presumably runs a task from an **Invoke** tasks file (often named `tasks.py` or similar).
- **Operation**: Creates the required tables and sets up any initial data seeds, if configured.

---

## 3. Running the Application

Start the server or main program entry point with:

```bash
python app.py
```

- **Default Port**: If the application is a web server, check the code or logs to see which port it binds to (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
- **Configuration**: You may need environment variables (e.g., `DB_URI`) or additional config files for different deployment settings.

### Additional Tips

1. **Testing**: If your project includes a test suite, run it (e.g., `pytest` or `python -m unittest discover`) before production deployment to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
2. **Virtual Environment**: Keep your dependencies isolated by using a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts and make the app easier to manage.
3. **Deployment**: If you plan to host this app on a remote server, consider automation tools (Docker, Ansible, etc.) or a PaaS (Heroku, etc.) for a smoother deployment process.
