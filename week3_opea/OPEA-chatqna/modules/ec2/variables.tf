# Terraform Variable Definitions for Cloud Infrastructure Deployment
#
# This configuration file defines all the input parameters required
# for setting up the cloud environment. Each variable is documented
# in detail to provide context on its purpose and usage.
##########################################################################

# The name of the project. This variable is used to generate resource names,
# ensuring that all deployed resources can be easily identified and associated
# with this specific project.
variable "project_name" {
  description = "The project name used as a prefix for naming AWS resources (e.g., instances, key pairs)."
  type        = string
}

# EC2 instance type determines the hardware configuration of the deployed instance.
# Choose a type that balances performance and cost (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large).
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Specifies the EC2 instance type to deploy. Examples include t2.micro, m5.large, etc."
  type        = string
}

# The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID specifies the operating system and software
# configuration for the EC2 instance. Make sure the AMI is available in your region.
variable "ami_id" {
  description = "The AMI ID used to launch the EC2 instance. Ensure the selected AMI is available in the target region."
  type        = string
}

# The subnet ID indicates the specific subnet within your VPC where the instance
# will be launched. This ensures proper network segmentation and connectivity.
variable "subnet_id" {
  description = "The ID of the subnet in which to launch the EC2 instance. This must be a valid subnet in your VPC."
  type        = string
}

# The security group ID defines the firewall rules that control access to the EC2 instance.
# This is critical for managing inbound and outbound network traffic.
variable "security_group_id" {
  description = "The ID of the security group associated with the instance, which defines the network access rules."
  type        = string
}

# The path to the SSH public key is required for configuring secure, key-based
# authentication for accessing the EC2 instance.
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  description = "The file path to your SSH public key used for authenticating with the instance."
  type        = string
}

# The path to the SSH private key is used in generating an SSH configuration file.
# It is essential for establishing a secure SSH connection to the instance.
variable "ssh_private_key_path" {
  description = "The file path to your SSH private key used in generating the SSH config for secure access."
  type        = string
}

# The root volume size determines the storage capacity allocated to the EC2 instance's root device.
# Adjust this based on your application's storage requirements.
variable "root_volume_size" {
  description = "The size of the root volume (in GB) attached to the EC2 instance."
  type        = number
}

# The Hugging Face API token allows access to models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face.
# This value is sensitive and will be masked in logs and outputs.
variable "huggingface_token" {
  description = "API token for Hugging Face services to access models securely. This token is sensitive and should remain confidential."
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

# The OPEA release version indicates which version of the application code to deploy.
# This variable helps in checking out the correct release tag during deployment.
variable "opea_release_version" {
  description = "Specifies the release version of the OPEA application to deploy. Used to checkout the correct version in the repository."
  type        = string
}

# The host operating system variable identifies the platform on which Terraform is being run.
# This is important for ensuring that any provisioners or local-exec commands use the correct syntax.
variable "host_os" {
  description = "The operating system of the host running Terraform (e.g., 'linux' or 'windows'). This affects script execution."
  type        = string
  default     = "linux"
}
```

This version provides comprehensive documentation for each variable, helping team members and future maintainers understand the purpose and constraints of each parameter.
